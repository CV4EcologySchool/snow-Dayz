Cleaning up modeled data

Weak Supervision 
* a way to get cheap data
- cheaper sources of labels that are noiser or heuristic 
- heuristic methods: background subtraction, water shed
    - heat maps -- takes peaks and valleys
    - 

- Using existing models 
    - NEON crown using LiDAR tree estimation model for pre-training
    - get a bunch of noisy labels and then label them as an expert 

- Cheaper annotations
    - detect animasl (with megadetector)
    - automate the bounding box to detect animals and then label the rest 

- Look at something that does the easier problem
- combine multiple sources: use snorkel!!

How do you report weak supervision in your methods? 
- labeled cloudy modis values 
- how many images are around day 3 or 4? becuase thats the day that it tends to really start to differ
- weather stations

Self-supervision
 - non contrastive methods: image in-painting, rotation, colorization
 - contrastive methods (pulling together similiar representations and pushing away dissimiliar representations)
 - SimCLR
 - SeCo
 
 Non contrastive methods - rotation 
 - unsupervissed models learn an encoder from a linear classifier, using linear layers in the encoder
 - they still don't do as well as supervised methods

  Contrastive methods -- SimCLR
  - make two pairs one image is not data augmentation and then oter the data point is augmented
  
  Contrastive methods - SeCo
  - seasonal contrast: unsupervised pre-training uncurated remote sensing data
